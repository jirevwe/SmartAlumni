    <div class="faq-question">
        <h6>What is an endowment fund?</h6>
        <p>An endowment fund is a permanent, self-sustaining source of funding. Endowment assets are invested. Each year, a portion of the value of the fund is paid out to support the fund’s purpose, and any earnings in excess of this distribution are used to build the fund’s market value. In this way, an endowment fund can grow and provide support for its designated purpose in perpetuity. When you establish an endowment fund, you create a permanent legacy.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>What else does it take?</h6>
        <p>An endowment agreement. This agreement between the donor and the school/university permanently defines the purpose of the fund. The agreement also outlines school’s standard procedures for managing endowment funds.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Do I need to sign an endowment agreement or meet a minimum gift level if I want to give to an existing endowment?</h6>
        <p>No. You can make a gift of any size to an existing endowment fund without signing an endowment agreement. There may be an existing endowment that reflects your interests and to which you can add your support. Also, many donors who have established endowment funds in the past continue making gifts to them over time. The larger a fund is, the more it can do each year.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Exactly how is the distribution from an endowment used?</h6>
        <p>The spending distribution from each endowment fund is used to support the fund’s direct costs as stated in the funds policy.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>What are the benefits of  an endowment fund?</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Creates an ongoing source of income. Because a permanent endowment is an invested pool of money that provides a reliable source of income in perpetuity, the organization can count on annual distributions for its designated work. Funds may be designated for endowment by the donor or by the board of directors. With appropriate investment and spending policies setup by the board, the endowment’s purchasing power will be preserved. Thus, a fund that generates income to operate a scholarship program for the less privilege today can be designed to produce income to run the same program 20 years from now and beyond. The endowment also grows over time with additional gifts from multiple donors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enhances stability and prestige. A well-managed endowment sends a message of planned long-term stability, fiscal responsibility, and financial viability. It enhances the organization’s prestige and credibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Relieves pressure on the annual fund. Annual fund goals tend to rise right along with the cost of providing services and operating the organization, but the ability of the annual fund to meet increasing demand is not limitless. An endowment can provide annual support for the school’s operating budget.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Allows program expansion. Program expansion can be funded with distributions from endowment funds used for scholarships, faculty chairs, staff positions, lecture series, research, facility maintenance, equipment and supplies, and for any other purpose designated by the donor or by the board of directors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Offers flexibility for management. Endowments offer options to meet new challenges by providing greater financial flexibility and self-sustaining income streams. Endowments can augment uncertain income sources, broaden the overall revenue mix, improve the income statement, and provide leverage for bond-rating capacity and loans for new facilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Builds pipeline of future gifts. A growing endowment builds a pipeline of gifts that will mature in the future, because many endowment gifts are designed to be used at a future date, often upon the death of the donor. An organization that attracts deferred gifts enhances its future financial security and positions itself to enjoy increasingly larger gifts in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Encourages outright gifts. Outright gifts as well as other kinds of planned gifts are encouraged by building an endowment. Donors who have decided to make an endowment gift to the organization are likely to make gifts to the organization’s annual and capital campaigns as well. After all, they have already made a commitment to the organization’s future.</p>
